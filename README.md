# Switcher

The goal of Switcher is to switch environment fastly for Google Projects.
Switcher helps to add and change environment variables for the list of programming languages and for Google Cloud Projects (e.g. Pubsub) that is stored in setting's json file.

To use in work it will be needed to set the file with settings (settings.json) adding programming language/s and key file. 
For now settings.json contains template for 8 programming languages and 6 Google Cloud Projects with example showing how to set credentials (e.g. projectID, path to credentials).  

Don't need to bother if key file in different folder, cause in settings.json you need to put the whole destination to that file :)
